## Known Limitations

The following features from the PRD are not yet fully implemented:

### Security & Rate Limiting

- ⚠️ **Captcha on registration** - Not implemented (hCaptcha/Turnstile)
- ⚠️ **IP-based registration limiting** - Max 3 registrations per IP/day not enforced
- ⚠️ **Manual check rate limit** - 1 check per offer per hour not enforced

### User Experience

- ⚠️ **Onboarding tooltips** - First-time user guidance not implemented
- ⚠️ **Enhanced landing page** - Basic landing exists, missing full content sections (Hero, Problem/Solution, Features, Pricing, FAQ)

### Monitoring & Alerts

- ⚠️ **Error alert system** - Monitoring logic exists, but email/webhook alerts for >15% error rate not configured
- ⚠️ **Advanced retry delays** - Retry exists but may not match exact PRD spec (1min, 5min, 15min)

### Configuration

- ⚠️ **AI confidence threshold** - Code uses 0.8, PRD specifies 0.9 minimum

## API Documentation

### Authentication

API endpoints use **session-based authentication** via Supabase Auth cookies. The authentication is handled automatically by the middleware.

**How it works:**

1. **Browser-based requests**: Cookies are automatically included with requests
2. **Middleware validation**: Each request is validated by `src/middleware/index.ts`
3. **User context**: Authenticated user ID is available in `locals.current_user_id`
4. **Unauthorized requests**: Return `401 Unauthorized` if no valid session

**For programmatic access (e.g., curl, Postman):**

You need to include the Supabase session cookies. After logging in via the web interface, extract the cookies from your browser's developer tools and include them in requests:

```bash
# Example with cookies (replace with actual session cookies)
curl http://localhost:4321/api/offers \
  -H "Cookie: sb-<project-ref>-auth-token=..."
```

**Special case - CRON endpoint:**

The `/api/cron/check-prices` endpoint uses **Bearer token authentication** instead of session cookies:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4321/api/cron/check-prices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"triggered_by": "pg_cron"}'
```

**Public endpoints** (no authentication required):

- `/api/auth/login`
- `/api/auth/register`
- `/api/auth/resend-verification`
- `/api/auth/forgot-password`
- `/api/auth/reset-password`

---

### GET /api/offers

Returns a paginated list of active offer subscriptions for the user.

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Default      | Description                                        |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `page`    | number | No       | `1`          | Page number (must be ≥1)                           |
| `size`    | number | No       | `10`         | Items per page (must be ≥1 and ≤100)               |
| `sort`    | string | No       | `created_at` | Sort column: `created_at`, `last_checked`, `title` |

**Response (200 OK):**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "BMW 320d 2015",
      "url": "https://otomoto.pl/...",
      "imageUrl": "https://...",
      "city": "Warszawa",
      "status": "active",
      "lastChecked": "2025-10-14T12:00:00Z",
      "currentPrice": 45000.0,
      "currency": "PLN",
      "percentChangeFromFirst": -5.2,
      "percentChangeFromPrevious": 1.1
    }
  ],
  "page": 1,
  "size": 10,
  "total": 42
}
```

**Error Responses:**

- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid query parameters (with validation details)
- `401 Unauthorized` - Authentication required
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Unexpected server error

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Get first page with default settings (requires authentication)
# In browser: Cookies are automatically included
# For curl: Include session cookies from browser after login
curl http://localhost:4321/api/offers \
  -H "Cookie: sb-<project-ref>-auth-token=<session-token>"

# Get second page with 20 items, sorted by last checked
curl "http://localhost:4321/api/offers?page=2&size=20&sort=last_checked" \
  -H "Cookie: sb-<project-ref>-auth-token=<session-token>"
```

**Note**: For browser-based requests, cookies are automatically included. For programmatic access, you need to extract the session cookie from your browser after logging in.

---

### POST /api/offers

Adds a new Otomoto.pl offer subscription for the authenticated user. The endpoint automatically extracts offer data (title, image, price, location) from the provided URL.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "url": "https://otomoto.pl/..."
}
```

**Response (201 Created):**

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "message": "Offer added"
}
```

**Error Responses:**

- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid URL, not from otomoto.pl domain, or data extraction failed
- `401 Unauthorized` - Authentication required
- `409 Conflict` - Offer URL already subscribed by the user
- `429 Too Many Requests` - Rate limit exceeded (max 5 active subscriptions or 10 additions per 24h)
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Unexpected server error

**Business Logic:**

1. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Maximum 5 active subscriptions per user
   - Maximum 10 offer additions per 24 hours (enforced by database trigger)

2. **Duplicate Handling:**
   - If user already has an active subscription to this URL → `409 Conflict`
   - If user previously deleted this subscription → reactivates it and returns `201`
   - If offer exists but is assigned to other users → creates new subscription, user sees price history from this point forward

3. **Data Extraction:**
   - Fetches HTML from the URL (30-second timeout)
   - Uses AI-powered extraction (OpenRouter) with fallback to CSS selectors
   - Extracts: title, image, price, currency, city
   - Validates extracted data (price must be between 0 and 10,000,000)

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Add new offer subscription (requires authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4321/api/offers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: sb-<project-ref>-auth-token=<session-token>" \
  -d '{"url": "https://otomoto.pl/osobowe/bmw/seria-3/..."}'
```

**Note**: In browser-based requests, cookies are automatically included. Extract session cookies from your browser after logging in for programmatic access.

| `page`    | number | No       | `1`     | Page number (must be ≥1)                 |
| `size`    | number | No       | `10`    | Items per page (must be ≥1 and ≤1000)    |

**Response (200 OK):**

  "size": 10,
  "total": 42
}
```

**Error Responses:**

- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid offer ID or query parameters

---

### POST /api/cron/check-prices

Scheduled endpoint for automated price checking. Called by `pg_cron` or external scheduler.

**Headers:**

- `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` - Required for authentication

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "triggered_by": "pg_cron"
}
```

**Response (200 OK):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "processed": 42,
  "message": "Price check completed successfully"
}
```

**Error Responses:**

- `401 Unauthorized` - Invalid or missing CRON_SECRET
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Processing failed

**Authentication:**

This endpoint uses **Bearer token authentication** instead of session cookies because it's called by external schedulers (e.g., pg_cron).

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Trigger price check (requires CRON_SECRET)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4321/api/cron/check-prices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"triggered_by": "pg_cron"}'
```

**Note**: `CRON_SECRET` must be set in environment variables and match the value sent in the Authorization header.
